## Introduction

Before you start using the Microsoft AI SDK for SAP, you will play with and fine-tune your prompt with the free [Microsoft Copilot from Bing](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1&FORM=hpcodx).

Alternatively, you may use [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com/)  or [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) if you have access to those apps.

## The path

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't want sign-in with Bing, you are limited to 4 prompts per day. If you want to use more prompts, you need to sign-in with your Microsoft account.

1. Get started with the following prompts:

`You are a virtual assistant suggesting creative product descriptions. Use less than 200 characters.`

`Create a description for the product with Name: Surface Laptop 3, Category: Laptop`

`Create the text in the tone of Homer Simpson`

2. Get crazy with some creative prompts and see what the AI comes up with for a couple of minutes.

3. Once you are happy with the result, move back to Eclipse and continue with quest 4.

> [!TIP]
> On Azure AI Studio use the playground to fine-tune your prompt. Use above first prompt as System Message.
