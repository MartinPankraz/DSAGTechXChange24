# SAP CAP on Azure

**[🏠Home](../README.md)** - [ Quest 1 >](student/quest1.md)

Digitization of business processes and deriving intelligent action automatically is one of the mega trends across all industries globally. As part of this mission, should you choose to accept it, you will experience challenges and solution approaches firsthand acting as the much needed incubation team 🐣 of the Contoso Inc.

You will be expanding your developer and architect horizon and ultimately be equipped to shape digitization efforts one step at a time. But first things first.

## Pre-requisites

- [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with quota for at least 1 App Service Plan (B1) and 1 Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL (citus) - Total Regional Coordinator Cores

> [!WARNING]
> Verify the latest [SAP's open-source license](https://github.com/cap-js) for SAP CAP for your reference. Please be aware if your SAP libraries are still using the [SAP Developer License](https://tools.eu1.hana.ondemand.com/developer-license-3_1.txt). Components are being added to open-source by SAP on an ongoing basis according to their road map published [here.](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/10/02/open-sourcing-cap-how-to-learn-more-or-get-involved/) When in doubt, consider the SAP Cloud SDK on Azure instead.
