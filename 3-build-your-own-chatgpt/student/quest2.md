# Quest 2 - Create a first ChatBot

[ < Quest 1 ](quest1.md) - **[ Quest 3 > ](quest3.md)**

With this first experience, of what is possible with GPT, lets create a first chatbot that allows you to interact with a public webpage

* Open the [Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com/) and log in with your Microsoft Work or School account (**not** @outlook.com, @live.com). 
> [!NOTE]
> If you do not have a Microsoft Work or School account yet, sign-up for the [M365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
> For the DSAGTechXChange Hands on, we will provide a username to you

* Enter the `Microsoft Corp / Work Email Address`
![Sign In](../media/quest2/01-SignIn.png)

* Provide your `password`
![Sign In](../media/quest2/02-Password.png)

* If required click on `Ask Later to skip` the additional authentication steps
![Sign In](../media/quest2/03-AskLater.png)

* Select `Stay signed in`
![Sign In](../media/quest2/04-StaySignIn.png)

* Click on `Start Free Trial`
![Sign In](../media/quest2/05-StartFreeTrial.png)

* Microsoft Copilot Studio is an evolution of Power Virtual Agent. Click on `Done` 
![Sign In](../media/quest2/06-PVA2Copilot.png)


* From `Home` Click on `+ Create a new Copilot` 
![Sign In](../media/quest2/07-NewCopilot.png)

* Provide the required input parameters, e.g. 

- a name for the new Copilot, e.g. `First DSAG Copilot`
- Select a language, e.g. `German`
- enter a URL to the root webiste that you want to query, e.g. `https://dsag.de/`

* Then click on `Create`

* It might take a few minutes, but then you should see a screen like this:
* Click on `Skip`
![Sign In](../media/quest2/09-SkipIntro.png)

* on the Left hand side you can already start testing the copilot. Enter a Question like: `What can you tell me about DSAG?`
![Sign In](../media/quest2/10-TestCopilot.png)

You should see a result with references to the public site from DSAG. 

* In order to better understand, what was happening, `switch on Tracing`, `Restart the session` and ask another question, e.g. `Wie kann ich Mitglied in der DSAG werden?`
![Sign In](../media/quest2/11-EnableTracing.png)

* On the right hand side, you can see that an `On Unkonwn Intent` trigger was used. Then the question was passed into the `Create generative answers` action and a result -- coming from a `public  website (1)` data source was used.

* Click on `Topics` to navigate to the `Topics` that are definied by default. 


* Click on `Gru√ü / Welcome` to see the Trigger phrases, that start this specific flow:
![Sign In](../media/quest2/13-Topics.png)

* Give it a try and enter one of these phrases to see this Trigger being executed

![Sign In](../media/quest2/15-Triggers.png)


* Notice that even if you enter another phrase (Guten Morgen / Guten Abend), the trigger is still executed:
![Sign In](../media/quest2/16-Trigger2.png)

* However, when you enter something else (e.g. we are in Hamburg, so I would expect `Moin` or `Tach`) to work as well, we are redirected to the `On Unknown Intent` trigger. 
![Sign In](../media/quest2/17-MissingPhrase.png)

* Click on `Topics`, and `Gru√ü / Welcome` to go back to the Greetings trigger. 
![Sign In](../media/quest2/18-MissingPhrase2.png)


* Click on the `Edit` link and add additional phrases, like `Moin`, `Tach`, 
![Sign In](../media/quest2/19-AddPhrase.png)

* Click on `Save` again, `restart the converstion` and try again with a phrase that previously did not work. 
![Sign In](../media/quest2/20-Retest-Phrase.png)

* Now the correct trigger should be started. 

* Before we publish this first version to a demo website, lets add the Icon that we had created in the previous step. 
Go to `Settings` and select `Copilot Details`.
![Sign In](../media/quest2/21-CopilotDetails.png)


* Here you can change the Name of the Chatbot, but more importantly also change the `icon`. Click on the `Change Icon` and upload the icon you previously created with Microsoft Designer- Then click on `Save`
![Sign In](../media/quest2/22-UploadIcon.png)

* Before publishing the bot, it is good to setup authentication. Navigate to `Settings` -> `Security` and select `Authentications`. Access from Teams and Power Apps is already protected via Azure Active Directory / Entra-ID. For our demo, we will switch the authentication to `No authentication` so we can easily access the bot from a demo website without the need to configure this new site with Entra-ID authentication. 

Note: You could configure AAD or any other Oauth2 identity provider (like the SAP BTP Identity Authentication service) from here

* Click on `Close`
![Sign In](../media/quest2/25-CloseAuthentication.png)

* Navigate to `Publish` and click on `Publish`
![Sign In](../media/quest2/26-PublishBot.png)

* Confirm the `Publish` latest content
![Sign In](../media/quest2/27-ConfirmPublish.png)

* After a few minutes you should get the confirmation that the copilot was published. Now click on `Go to Channels`
![Sign In](../media/quest2/28-GoToChannel.png)

* And click on `Demo website`
![Sign In](../media/quest2/29-SelectDemoSite.png)

* Click on `Copy` to get the URL of the new Webiste and open it in a new browser. 
![Sign In](../media/quest2/30-CloseDemosite.png)



* We now have a working Chatbot that works with data from a website that you specified. In addition to this demo website, this Chatbot could be exposed to Teams or also embedded within a SAP Fiori Launchpad.
