 # Quest 1 - Leveraging GPT to create images

**[🏠Home](../README.md)** - [ Quest 2 >](quest2.md)


* We will start our ChatBot and Generative AI journey by creating a few images. An easy way to get started are Microsoft Designer and Bing Image Creator, powered by DALL-E3. 

Feel free to check out both and play around with creating some images.  

* Go to [Microsoft Designer](https://designer.microsoft.com/image-creator) to open the Microsoft Designer
![Sign In](../media/quest1/01-SignInDesigner.png)

* Alternatively or in addition you can also go to [Bing Image Creator](https://www.bing.com/images/create)



* `Sign in` With your Microsoft ID (e.g. outlook.com, hotmail.com, live.com)
![Sign In](../media/quest1/02-OutlookUser.png)


* Enter a prompt like 
```
In cartoon style a group of people in a city like Hamburg learning all about SAP and AI
```
![Sign In](../media/quest1/03-EnterPrompt.png)

* As a result you should see an image like this:

Like with all prompting it is important to learn how to work with the AI and create the best results. 
You can test out some ideas using the following links:

As you will notice, prompts often have adjectives and descriptions to make the generated image more explicit. Here are a few other ideas to improve your prompt: 
 
* **Other materials you might try**: "felt," "tapestry," "knitting," "embroidery," "papercraft," "origami," "pop-up books," "modelling clay," "porcelain," "ceramics," "terracotta," "metalwork," "jewelry," "crystal," "fiberglass"…even "butter."

* `Right click` on the image and save it to your laptop
![Sign In](../media/quest1/05-SaveImage.png)

* Since we want to use this image as an icon for our Chatbot in the next Quest, we need to resize it quite a bit. Since we don't want to install any other tools we will just use any Online resizing tool (feel free to use anything else). For this go to [ImageResizer](https://imageresizer.com/) and select the image that you just downloaded
![Sign In](../media/quest1/06-ImageResizer.png)


* Since we need a rather small image, select enter `70` for the Width and click on `Resize Image` 
![Sign In](../media/quest1/06a-Resize.png)

* Now you should have a much smaller image, that you can download by clicking on `Download image`. We will use this new icon later on.
